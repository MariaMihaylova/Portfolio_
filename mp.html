                <p>This semester's Media Design course has been an enriching and fulfilling experience for me. Throughout the course, I have delved into various aspects of media production, including logo design, photography, and videography. <br><br> The
                    individual logo design assignment was a great opportunity to showcase my creativity and design skills. Creating a logo for a brand of my choice allowed me to explore different visual elements and concepts. This project challenged me
                    to think critically about brand identity and create a visually appealing logo that communicates the brand's message effectively. <br><br> In the realm of photography, I had the opportunity to create a photography portfolio photo book.
                    This project involved using a DSLR camera and performing various tasks to capture compelling images. Through this assignment, I learned about composition, lighting, and storytelling within the medium of photography. The photo book
                    served as a culmination of my photography skills, presenting a collection of visually stunning images that showcased my ability to capture captivating moments. <br><br>The videography assignments were equally engaging and allowed me
                    to explore the art of storytelling through moving images. One of the notable projects was the creation of a mini documentary on the housing situation in the Netherlands. Collaborating with my group, we brainstormed ideas, created a
                    storyboard, and filmed scenes to bring our vision to life. This project enabled me to develop skills in filming, editing, and understanding the power of visual storytelling. <br><br>Overall, this Media Design course has provided a
                    comprehensive understanding of various aspects of media production. From logo design to photography and videography, I have developed skills in visual communication, storytelling, and user-centered design. The hands-on projects and
                    assignments have challenged me to think creatively, develop technical expertise, and understand the impact of media design on audience perception.

                <h3>Videography</h3>
                <p>For our final Media production assignment we had to work on a mini documentary, a short movie of max 5 minutes. After a little brainstorming we came to the decision to make a short documentary on the current housing situation in the Natherlands.
                    Westarted by creating a ruff storyboard and discussed what scences need to be film. With the group decided to spend one day specificly for going around, exploring and filming some shots for the video.

                <h3>Videography</h3>
                <p>After gathering information from our research, we were asked to create a video for our user scenario. The whole experience was very interesting. Besides learning how to edit, voiceover, and film, we got to go more in-depth into our research
                    and understand who our users are, what they do, and what they want and like. In my opinion, this was one of my favorite assignments - fun, challenging, and yet very helpful.
