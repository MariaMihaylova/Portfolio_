                <h4></h4>
                <p>This project report focuses on the design and development of a minimalist website for Erion Kapaj, an accomplished individual artist and art teacher based in Athens, Greece. The objective of the project is to create a comprehensive and
                    visually stunning portfolio website that effectively represents Erion's artistic talents and enhances their exposure. Thorough research was conducted using interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, and trend analysis to inform the
                    design and development process. The report outlines the research methods employed, addresses research questions, and highlights the process and results achieved in each phase: empathy, define, and testing. The conclusion emphasizes
                    the successful implementation of the project goals and recommends the website as a powerful tool for Erion to showcase their work, attract clients and collaborators, and fulfil their career objectives.</p>

                <h2>Interviews - Prototype </h2>
                <h4></h4>
                <p>In the following document you can find a summary of the user responses collected from interviews conducted to gather feedback on our digital prototypes. The objective of these interviews was to evaluate users' perceptions of the prototypes'
                    design, layout, and overall structure. By analyzing the insights obtained, we can make informed decisions and implement necessary improvements for future iterations. During the interviews, we engaged with users to understand their
                    thoughts and impressions of the prototypes. We asked specific questions to gauge their satisfaction with the design elements, navigation, and overall user experience. Their feedback provided valuable insights that will guide our decision-making
                    process.Users expressed appreciation for the prototypes' clean and intuitive design, which made it easy for them to navigate and understand the content. The layout was well-received, with users finding it visually appealing and organized.
                    They particularly praised the clear call-to-action buttons and the logical flow of information. However, the interviews also highlighted areas that require attention and improvement. Some users mentioned that certain features were
                    not easily discoverable, indicating a need for improved visibility and guidance.By incorporating these improvements into our next prototype iterations, we aim to create a digital product that aligns closely with our users' needs and
                    expectations.

                <p>After gathering all the information from the survey and interview we had/made, it was time for us to create our user personas. After analysing the data we had gather though our different research methods, I started creating the two following
                    personas. Since I did not have previous experience with creating personas I always checked up with my group members to get feedback and their opinion on how I did. Moreover, after receiving more feedback from teachers and my colleagues,
                    I can say that the personas I have created were good.</p>

                <p>Since gathering as much information as possible from our research, our group decided that we need to start brainstorming ideas and start prototyping. In last week's meeting, we discussed that each of us should start brainstorming website
                    layout ideas so on our next meeting we can further talk about how we would like to proceed with the layout. The prototypes displayed are just some low-fidelity prototypes which later on I would work on more in Figma and ask for feedback
                    from my team members and teachers.</p>

                <p>After gathering information from our research we were asked to create a video for our user scenario. The whole experiece was ver interesting. Besides learning how edit, voiceove, and film we got go more indepthinto our research and understand
                    who are users are and what they do, want, like. In my opinion this was one of my favourite assignments, fun, challenging and yet very helpfu.

                    on the survey and persona part, I had to change some stuff in the document. For example, I had to add more information on my choices and more description so that everything is understandable.</p>

                <p>To get users feedback and to make changes and improvements on the design in the development phase we conducted a survey, as one as the fastest way to get the users point of view. Me and one of my group members worked on the questions that
                    the survey contained so we could get as much valuable information as possible.By doing the survey, we can much easier understand how our audience enjoys art and get better feedback on what our client needs and use it to our advantage.
                    The conducted survey contained some of the following questions that were answered by 20 people.
